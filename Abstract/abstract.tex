\textit{TapeYty} is a tool developed to calculate optimal paths for urban garbage collection vehicles in the Asunción city. This tool generates benefits mainly in the economic and environmental aspects of the city where a large number of people brings a high generation of waste. This makes the complexity of garbage management even greater. 

The routing problem is treated as the directed open rural postman problem which seeks to minimize the distance to be traveled by the collection vehicles. To achieve the objective \textit{TapeYty} is based on mathematical programming techniques and Geographical Informatiom System (GIS) tool which allows the management of the route network, being able to update the road way and their state of blocked or nonblocked. This implies that when changes of street states are submitted  \textit{TapeYty} modifies the graph that represents the road network and re-calculates the solutions providing new optimal routes to each collection vehicle. 

The tool has provided solutions that save on average 20\% of distance compared to current tour.
